## CollectorsApp

# Project Git partner
This repo is only the backend of my web application. The frontend can be found in the "collection-app-frontend" repository.

# Project Overview
This was a school project I did at the first semester of my master studies. The goal of this project was to learn ASP .NET Core and deepen my React skills.
I choose an app, that could be useful for my every day life. One of my hobbies to collect sport trading cards(mainly soccer/football), but I couldn't keep track of them. So I decided to develop a web application, where I can store information about them(picture, title, buying price, current value, etc.)

Later on I extended this with my thesis project, which is a support system for our sport bets, using data visualization and deep learning. For my thesis I developed an android app and used tensorflow lite, to make the prediction(neural network). In this project I'm using a c# backend and running the script from a python script. This is not the best solution, but it helped my learn, how I can run scripts and pass information between different programming languages. 

In the future I want to further develop this system, so that it can keep track of all my valuable belongings(crypto, stocks, other collection item, cash, etc.)

# Skills learned
ASP .NET CORE: I've used it in the past, but I managed to learn a few useful skills(for example: how I can run scripts and pass information between different programming languages)
Application programming interface: REST API -> Before this project I only used REST API in a few school labs. This helped my understand it clearer. I still need to learn more about tokenization.

# In the future 
I want to further develop this system, so that it can keep track of all my valuable belongings(crypto, stocks, other collection item, cash, etc.)
